# Installing
Simply download the latest ZIP file from [the releases page](https://github.com/abso1utezer0/BlueThinnerLite/releases/) and extract it to the desired location.

# FAQ
## How do I use this?
Check out the [Epic Mickey Docs website](https://docs.epicmickey.wiki).
## I can't open the application, it's being blocked as a virus
This should not be happening as I test any releases before sending them out. If it is occurring, please follow [this guide](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/blob/develop/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/antivirus.md#reporting-false-positives-to-av-vendors) if you have time to spare and then force Windows Defender to ignore the folder. Its unfortunately pretty common for Windows to mark PyInstaller apps as viruses, and there's not really much I can do to fix it other than moving code around until its no longer seen as a virus. Windows Defender is pretty stupid.

If you can't get it to work, you can simply download the source code and run the main.py file with Python.
